# Environmental Monitor

## Data captured

Data is published to serial bus once per second as a comma delimited string.

Example:

```csv
27.20,35,602,1021,-66.64
```

* Temperature - Celsius
* Humidity - Percent
* Light - Analog value between 0 and 1023
* Pressure - Pa
* Altitude  - m (Not accurate)

## Sensors

* DHT11 - temperature + humidity
* BMP085 - temperature + pressure
* LDR - light

## Config

* Serial - `9600`
* LDR - `A0`
* DHT11 - `4`
* BMP085 - `0x77`

## Publishing to MQTT

`serToMQTT.py` takes the data published by the Arduino and forwards it to an MQTT broker.

It takes the name of the serial port and name of the room it is in as parameters.

```bash
python serToMQTT.py "/dev/ttyACM0" "livingroom"
```
